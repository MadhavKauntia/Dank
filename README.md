## Idea

When we write a computer program there are many things that our IDE handles in the background. The user only gets the final output but what if the output is not right? What if you can't understand what is going on in your program. Our idea will help us to visualize your code instantly as soon as you enter each line. All the variables, data structures, loops will be shown to you graphically with each iteration. What's inside your variable, what is happening in a recursion, how the table changes when you work on dynamic programming related codes. All in all, A Game To Debug is a C++ visual debugger. The debugger will use a universal way to handle all sorts of code.

## Tools and Technologies

* GDB (GNU Debugger)
* Python
* PHP
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript

## Instructions to Run
* The application is hosted at dank.gametodebug.tech
* You can add your code directly to the code editor.

### OR

* Clone the repository.
* Put the code in the h.cpp file in the gdb folder.
* Run the new.py script in the gdb folder.
* Certain new files will be generated in the gdb folder, among which, logFile.txt and new_datatypes.txt are the log files that will be used to generate the debugger.
* In case these files are empty, check the error.txt file for any errors and try again after removing any bugs.
* We're sending a request from AWS to localhost using a POST request, thus we get the required log files which we parse in PHP, and then we read them as lists in JavaScript.
* Finally, we use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display the debugging details in an accordion format on the webpage. For this, open temp_code.html.

# Applications and Future Scope

Game To Debug will help anyone who is having a hard time solving bugs in his code. Using our application teachers and students can save a lot of time when try to teach and understand the algorithms and data-structures. We believe that our application can help anyone who is try to better understand his code. 
Game To Debug has many future scopes. Currently it has support for only C/C++ but it can be extended to many other languages. We are still having a hard time to figuring out the most appropriate visualise for various data structures present especially when it comes to N dimensional arrays and lists. We are successfully debugging most of the code that anyone can write using C/C++ but are debugger is still not full proof. We believe that working further on this project can revolutionize the way we study and understand our code.
